## Reflections
This assignment was fairy straightforward, I think the hardest part of the assignment was figuring out the logic for the popup modal do be able to pass in a dynamic amount of names and functions and associate them with buttons. I also had to use try catch blocks in the logic in a case something was passed in that was not a function. Another problem I ran into that I was not able to resolve was that the functionality to add a round through the form was not implemented in the starter code and it caused errors when I tried copying and pasting from a later chapter. So rather than spending too much time on it, I just made a button that simulates the dialog if a round's delete button was clicked.

## Notes
The add and delete round functionality were not implemented in the class starter code. So I just added a button that brings up the confirm delete prompt as if the delete button was pressed on a round.
